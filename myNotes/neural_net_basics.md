# Neural Networks Basics

## what is a input data?

"Itâ€™s a number that you recorded in the real world somewhere". andrew trask

## what is a prediction?

"A prediction is what the neural network tells you". It not always is right but it can learn from it. It can predict with multiple inputs and multiple outputs 

## what is a weight?

It is like the sensitive of the net. When you train the neural net it means to adjust the weights for have an accurate prediction how we can do it?

## Learning methods

Hot and cold: it consist on wiggling the weight to see when it reduce the error

gradient descent:
