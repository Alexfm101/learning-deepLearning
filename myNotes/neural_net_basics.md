# Neural Networks Basics

## what is a input data?

"It’s a number that you recorded in the real world somewhere". andrew trask

## what is a prediction?

"A prediction is what the neural network tells you". It not always is right but it can learn from it. It can predict with multiple inputs and multiple outputs 

## what is a weight?

It is like the sensitive of the net. When you train the neural net it means to adjust the weights for have an accurate prediction how we can do it?

The objective of build a neural network is to compute a error function with a bunch of weight. Then you will have a relationship of the error and the weight of the network and with that information, you can change the weight to reduce the error to 0.

You will  use the alpha variable to reduce weight update so it doesn’t overshoot.

## Learning methods

Hot and cold: it consist on wiggling the weight to see when it reduce the error

gradient descent: it consist on to find the minimums error for learning
